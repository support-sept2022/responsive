    <h1>Sketch of

        <h3>Note C</h3>
        <p> Those who may desire to study the principles of the Jacquard-loom in the most effectual manner, viz. that of
            practical observation, have only to step into the Adelaide Gallery or the Polytechnic Institution. In each
            of these valuable repositories of scientific illustration, a weaver is constantly working at a
            Jacquard-loom, and is ready to give any information that may be desired as to the construction and modes of
            acting of his apparatus. The volume on the manufacture of silk, in Lardner's Cyclop√¶dia, contains a chapter
            on the Jacquard-loom, which may also be consulted with advantage.</p>
        <p>The mode of application of the cards, as hitherto used in the art of weaving, was not found, however, to be
            sufficiently powerful for all the simplifications which it was desirable to attain in such varied and
            complicated processes as those required in order to fulfil the purposes of an Analytical Engine. A method
            was devised of what was technically designated backing the cards in certain groups according to certain
            laws. The object of this extension is to secure the possibility of bringing any particular card or set of
            cards into use any number of times successively in the solution of one problem. Whether this power shall be
            taken advantage of or not, in each particular instance, will depend on the nature of the operations which
            the problem under consideration may require. The process is alluded to by M. Menabrea, and it is a very
            important simplification. It has been proposed to use it for the reciprocal benefit of that art, which,
            while it has itself no apparent connexion with the domains of abstract science, has yet proved so valuable
            to the latter, in suggesting the principles which, in their new and singular field of application, seem
            likely to place algebraical combinations not less completely within the province of mechanism, than are all
            those varied intricacies of which intersecting threads are susceptible. By the introduction of the system of
            backing into the Jacquard-loom itself, patterns which should possess symmetry, and follow regular laws of
            any extent, might be woven by means of comparatively few cards.</p>
        <p>Those who understand the mechanism of this loom will perceive that the above improvement is easily effected
            in practice, by causing the prism over which the train of pattern-cards is suspended to revolve backwards
            instead of forwards, at pleasure, under the requisite circumstances; until, by so doing, any particular
            card, or set of cards, that has done duty once, and passed on in the ordinary regular succession, is brought
            back to the position it occupied just before it was used the preceding time. The prism then resumes its
            forward rotation, and thus brings the card or set of cards in question into play a second time. This process
            may obviously be repeated any number of times. </p>
